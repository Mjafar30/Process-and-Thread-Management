# Process-and-Thread-Management
## Description
This project involves researching and comparing different approaches to process and thread management in software development. The focus is on the performance, throughput, and resource utilization of single-process execution, multi-process execution, and multi-threaded execution using the POSIX standard and Pthreads library.

### Features
- Single process execution analysis
- Multi-process execution analysis
- Multi-threaded execution analysis

### Requirements
- Linux operating system
- GCC (for compiling C code)
- POSIX standard libraries, specifically Pthreads
